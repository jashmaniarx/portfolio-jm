    question: "Are these projects finished products?",
    answer:
      "No, these are strictly prototypes designed to demonstrate UI/UX capabilities, design thinking, and technical skills. They showcase concept implementation rather than production-ready applications.",
  },
  {
    question: "Can these be expanded into full applications?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the prototypes are built with scalable architectures and can be adapted into fully functional applications with additional development, backend integration, and feature expansion.",
  },
  {
    question: "What technologies do you use?",
    answer:
      "Projects are built primarily with React, TypeScript, Tailwind CSS, shadcn/ui components, and Vite. Additional libraries are incorporated as needed for specific functionality.",
  },
  {
    question: "Are skills applied practically?",
    answer:
      "Yes, each project demonstrates practical application of design thinking, problem-solving, frontend development, and UI/UX principles. The portfolio itself showcases these competencies.",
  },
  {
    question: "Is this site fully responsive?",
    answer:
      "Yes, the portfolio is optimized for desktop, tablet, and mobile devices with responsive layouts, touch-friendly interactions, and performance considerations across all screen sizes.",

    answer:
      "Yes, the portfolio is actively maintained. New projects demonstrating emerging skills, technologies, and design approaches are added regularly.",

  },
  {
    question: "How are animations applied?",
    answer:
      "Animations are implemented subtly to enhance user experience without overwhelmingâ€”including microanimations on hover, fade-in effects on scroll, and smooth transitions between states.",
  },
  {
    question: "How can employers contact you?",
    answer:
      "Contact information and professional profiles are available in the footer, including links to GitHub and CodePen for additional work examples.",
